Using the project folder messenger-afternoon:

Wrap the application data and code not currently in a class, into a class called Messenger
Receive a reference to the DOM element ul#messages as a parameter to the constructor
Create an instance of a Messenger() and ensure that the application behaves as it did before
Consider how new messages would be created and where the function would be stored
Build the functionality in code, or just write down what you think would need to be done
Create a User class based on what you think it needs to hold (properties) and do (methods)
When a new Message is created, ensure it has a User instance to send to and from
